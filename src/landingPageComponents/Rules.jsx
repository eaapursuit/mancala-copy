            <ul>
              <li>
                Players take turns picking up all stones from one of their pits
                and sowing them counterclockwise, one stone per pit.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the last stone lands in your store, you take another turn.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the last stone lands in an empty pit on your side, you
                capture all stones in the directly opposite pit and add them to
                your store.

            <h2>Endgame</h2>
            <p>
              The game ends when all six pits on one side are empty. The
              remaining stones on the other side are collected by that player.
              The player with the most stones in their store wins.
